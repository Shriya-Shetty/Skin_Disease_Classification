# ðŸ§  Skin Disease Classification App using YOLOv8 + Streamlit

A full-featured web application that classifies various skin diseases using a custom-trained **YOLOv8** classification model. Users can either upload an image or use their webcam for real-time predictions.

The app is fully developed in **Streamlit**, supports **database integration**, and is **deployed on Streamlit Cloud** for easy access.
